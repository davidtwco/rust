   = note: conflict markers indicate that a merge was started but could not be completed due to merge conflicts
           to resolve a conflict, keep only the code you want and then delete the lines containing conflict markers
   = help: if you're having merge conflicts after pulling new code:
           the top section is the code you already had and the bottom section is the remote code
           if you're in the middle of a rebase:
           the top section is the code being rebased onto and the bottom section is the code coming from the current commit being rebased
   = note: for an explanation on these markers from the `git` documentation:
